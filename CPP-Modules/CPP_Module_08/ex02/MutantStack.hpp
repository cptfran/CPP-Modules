//The stack adapter follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, and the insertion and removal of elements can be
//done only from the top of the queue container.
//The following are the key operations of the stack:
//push(elm): Insert the element elm at the top.
//pop(): Removes the top element.
//top(): Returns a reference to the top element.
//empty(): Checks whether the stack is empty.
//size(): Returns the number of elements.

//The stack is an adapter container, means they are created based on other containers like deque, vector, list
//with '::c' we can access base container in adapter container.

// Note: '::c' is an implementation detail and is not part of the official C++ specification.
// It may not be available in all C++ implementations.
